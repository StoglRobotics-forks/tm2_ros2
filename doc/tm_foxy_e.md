# __TM ROS Driver Usage and Installation__
The TM ROS Windows driver is designed to interface the TM Robot's operating software (__TMflow2__) with the Robot Operating System (ROS) so that program developers and researchers can build and reuse their own programs to control the TM robot externally.

## __1. Usage and Installation__
> * This manual is for <u>**ROS2 Foxy**</u> vs _TMflow2_ version.<br/>
> * TM ROS driver is embedded in the robot controller via _TMflow 2_ and is based on ROS2 Foxy.<br/>
>> :bulb: The operation interface of _TMflow2_: Navigate to __≡__ and click to expand the function menu, including the icons __Login/Logout__, __Connect__, __View__, __Run Setting__, __Project__, __Configuration__, and __System__. Please refer to _Software Manual TMflow_ ([SW2.14_Rev1.00](https://www.tm-robot.com/zh-hant/wpfd_file/software-manual-tmflow_sw2-14_rev1-00_en/)).<br/>
>> * The driver-embedded function related to the robot can be set in __Configuration__ &rArr; __ROS Settings__ of the _TMflow 2_.
>
> * Just clone the TM ROS App of the git repository into your working directory and then build it.<br/>
>
> &#10148;  After installing the correct ROS version of the computer, the next step is to ensure that your hardware, control computer, and TM Robot are all properly configured to communicate with each other. See below to make sure the network settings on your computer are correct, the TM Robot's operating software (_TMflow 2_) network settings are ready and the __Listen node__ is running.<br/>
<div> </div>

## __2. TMflow Listen node setup__
The __Listen node__: a socket server can be established and be connected with ROS by an external device to communicate according to the [defined protocol](https://assets.omron.eu/downloads/manual/en/v1/i689_tm_collaborative_robot_software_manual_tmflow_version_2_operation_manual_en.pdf). The user can make the robot communicate with the user's ROS (remote) computer equipment through a wired network when all the network parameters in the _Network setting_ are set.<br/>
>
> 1. Create a _Listen task_ of flow project of __TMflow__ software, and then drag the __Listen node__ from the __Node List__ menu (&rArr; Communication &rArr; Listen) onto the project flow, as shown below.
>
<br/>

   <img src="./figures/listen_task.png" width="1000" height="500">

> 2. Set the `Network` settings: mouse-click to enter the page of __System &rArr; Network__ in order.  
> &#10148; Example: Set the Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 and IP address 192.168.10.2 <br/> 
>> **Note**: Set the network mask and the communication with the TM Robot must be in the set domain.<br/> 
> 
<br/>

###  &sect; __Remote connection to TM ROBOT__
> Static IP of remote connection network settings through the wired network.<br/> 
>
> 1. Set the wired network of the user's (remote) Ubuntu computer by mouse-click on the top right of the desktop &rArr; Click on "__Wired Settings__" &rArr; Click on the gear icon &rArr; In the IPv4 feature options, click on "Manual" in order.<br/> 
<br/>

   <img src="./figures/user_remote_network_settings.png" width="1000" height="500">

> 2. Set the Static IP settings: where the IP address is fixed for the first three yards same as the previous setting 192.168.10, last yards 3-254 machine numbers are available. (Because _TM ROBOT_, you have been set to 192.168.10.2)<br/> 
> &#10148;  Example: Set the Netmask: 255.255.255.0 and IP address 192.168.10.30 <br/>
<br/>

   <img src="./figures/user_remote_IP_example.png" width="1000" height="500">

> 3. Check Internet connection: start a terminal to test the connectivity with the target host _TM ROBOT_, by typing ping 192.168.10.2
> 
<br/>

   ![ping_target_host](./figures/ping_target_host.png)

>> :bulb: **Tip**: Remember to reconfigure the network settings due to <u>static IP changes</u> or <u>replacement of the ROS control PC</u>.<br/>
>> As mentioned above, a valuable debugging tool is your operating system's <u>ping</u> command. If nothing appears to happen or an error is thrown, the robot cannot be accessed from your computer. Please go back to the top of this chapter and re-operate in the order of instructions.<br/>
>> If you are an experienced user, you may just need to <u>turn off</u> &rArr; <u>turn on</u> the gear icon of "__Wired Settings__" on your computer or to <u>turn off</u> &rArr; <u>turn on</u> the "__Ethernet Slave Data Table__" setting of the robot to reconfigure the hardware settings.<br/>

###  &sect; TMflow Vision node usage
> &#10148; Receive image data on the user's Linux computer from the TMflow Vision node.<br/>
> :bulb: Do you prepare the TM Robot ready? Make sure that TM Robot's operating software (TMflow) relative __HTTP Parameters__ Vision settings and __ROS Settings__ _(ROS Drive status: &rArr; __`Running`__)_ are ready and the __Vision task__ project is running. Do you build TM relative ROS apps <sup>1</sup> on your (remote) computer?<br/>
>
> Now, in a new terminal of your (remote) ROS2 Linux computer: Source setup.bash in the workspace path and run to get image data from TMvision&trade; by typing
>
> ```bash
> source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
> cd <workspace>
> export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_fastrtps_cpp
> export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=<ROS_DOMAIN_ID>
> source ./install/setup.bash
> ros2 run image_sub sub_img
> ```
>
>> **Note**: The <ROS_DOMAIN_ID> is the key to ROS communication and must be the same as the value of _TM Flow 2_ in the _ROS Settings_.<br/>
>
> Then, the viewer will display image data from _TMflow_.<br/>
> **Note**: When you are finished, press CTRL + C in all terminal windows to shut everything down.<br/>
<div> </div>

## __4. ROS Settings on Configuration__ 
> In the ROS Settings, the user can enter the domain ID and turn on the TM ROS driver using the toggle button.
> Navigate to __Configuration &rArr; ROS Setting__ and check the _ROS Drive Status_: When the _ROS Drive Status_ label prompts is _Running_, it means the TM ROS Driver is ready.<br/>
>> The TM ROS driver requires the TM Ethernet Slave to communicate with the robot information and publish it as a ROS topic; therefore, when the TM ROS Driver is running, the TM Ethernet Slave will be occupied and cannot be closed manually.
>> For the convenience of ROS users, once it is turned on, it will be automatically turned on by default. If the user confirms that they no longer want to use the "embedded TM ROS Driver" function, the user must manually turn it off again to allow the system memory to return to the default off. 
>
> &#10148; Run the embedded ROS driver
> Mouse-click to enable the `Slave Setup` setting and wait for the status: &rArr; __`Running`__. 
<br/>
